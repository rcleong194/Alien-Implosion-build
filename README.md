# Alien-Implosion-build

University Honours project for IMY 773 at the University of Pretoria.

The objective of the game is to stay alive as long as possible by throwing various balls at approaching aliens.

This project was built using Unity (2017.X.X) but does build with the 2020 LTS version of Unity.
This is a VR title created specifically for the VIVE using SteamVR 1.0. 
This repo only contains the build for the game. For queries regarding source code, please contact me.
